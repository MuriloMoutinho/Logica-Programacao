/*Usually when you buy something, you're asked whether
your credit card number, phone number or answer to your most 
secret question is still correct. However, since someone could
look over your shoulder, you don't want that shown on your screen.
Instead, we mask it.
Your task is to write a function maskify, which changes all but 
the last four characters into '#'.*/
